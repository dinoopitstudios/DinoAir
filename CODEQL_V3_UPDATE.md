# CodeQL Action v3 Update

## Changes Made

✅ **Updated GitHub Actions workflow** - `.github/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml`

### CodeQL Action Version Updates:

- `github/codeql-action/init@v2` → `github/codeql-action/init@v3`
- `github/codeql-action/autobuild@v2` → `github/codeql-action/autobuild@v3`
- `github/codeql-action/analyze@v2` → `github/codeql-action/analyze@v3`
- `github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v2` → `github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3`

### Documentation Updates:

- Updated `CODEQL_SETUP_COMPLETE.md` to reflect v3 usage

## Reason for Update

GitHub deprecated CodeQL Action v1 and v2 as of January 10, 2025. All workflows must use v3 to continue functioning properly.

## Impact

- ✅ Workflow will continue to work with latest GitHub Actions
- ✅ Access to latest CodeQL features and security improvements
- ✅ No breaking changes - v3 is backward compatible with v2 configurations

## Verification

All 4 CodeQL action references in the workflow have been successfully updated to v3. The workflow is now future-proof and compliant with GitHub's current requirements.
