# Keep this package lightweight at import time.
# Importing heavy/optional modules (e.g., pseudocode_translator) here breaks route imports
# because `from api.services.router_client import get_router` first executes this __init__.
# Export search-only re-exports and provide access to router_client without importing translator.


# Do NOT import translator module here to avoid optional dependency import at package import time.
# Callers should import api.services.translator directly if needed.
