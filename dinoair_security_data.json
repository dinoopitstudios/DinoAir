          "help": "# Unreachable 'except' block\nWhen handling an exception, Python searches the except blocks in source code order until it finds a matching `except` block for the exception. An except block, `except E:`, specifies a class `E` and will match any exception that is an instance of `E`.\n\nIf a more general except block precedes a more specific except block, then the more general block is always executed and the more specific block is never executed. An except block, `except A:`, is more general than another except block, `except B:`, if `A` is a super class of `B`.\n\nFor example: `except Exception:` is more general than `except Error:` as `Exception` is a super class of `Error`.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nReorganize the `except` blocks so that the more specific `except` is defined first. Alternatively, if the more specific `except` block is no longer required then it should be deleted.\n\n\n## Example\nIn this example the `except Exception:` will handle `AttributeError` preventing the subsequent handler from ever executing.\n\n\n```python\n\n\ndef incorrect_except_order(val):\n    try:\n        val.attr\n    except Exception:\n        print (\"Exception\")\n    except AttributeError:\n        print (\"AttributeError\")\n        \n\n```\n\n## References\n* Python Language Reference: [The try statement](http://docs.python.org/2.7/reference/compound_stmts.html#try), [Exceptions](http://docs.python.org/2.7/reference/executionmodel.html#exceptions).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-561](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/561.html).\n"
