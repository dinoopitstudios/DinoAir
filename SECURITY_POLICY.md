# DinoAir Security Policy

## Healthcare & Critical Infrastructure Grade Security

### Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented to ensure DinoAir meets the stringent security requirements for healthcare organizations, ambulance services, and other critical infrastructure environments.

## Compliance Frameworks

- **HIPAA** (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)
- **SOC 2 Type II** (Service Organization Control 2)
- **ISO 27001** (Information Security Management)
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**

## Security Architecture

### 1. Data Classification

```
PUBLIC:     Marketing materials, public documentation
INTERNAL:   System logs, configuration (non-sensitive)
CONFIDENTIAL: Patient data, medical records, emergency response data
RESTRICTED: Authentication credentials, encryption keys, audit logs
```

### 2. Secret Management

- **NO SECRETS IN CODE**: All sensitive data managed via environment variables or secure vaults
- **Secret Rotation**: Automated 90-day rotation for all credentials
- **Vault Integration**: Azure Key Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or HashiCorp Vault
- **Access Control**: Principle of least privilege for secret access

### 3. Data Encryption

#### At Rest

- **Database**: AES-256 encryption for all database files
- **Backups**: Encrypted backups with separate key management
- **Temporary Files**: Encrypted temporary storage with automatic cleanup
- **Logs**: Encrypted audit logs with integrity verification

#### In Transit

- **TLS 1.3**: All network communications encrypted
- **Certificate Pinning**: API client certificate validation
- **Perfect Forward Secrecy**: Ephemeral key exchanges
- **HSTS**: HTTP Strict Transport Security headers

### 4. Authentication & Authorization

#### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

- Required for all administrative access
- TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) support
- Hardware security keys (FIDO2/WebAuthn)
- Emergency recovery codes

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

```
VIEWER:     Read-only access to non-sensitive data
OPERATOR:   Standard user operations, data entry
SUPERVISOR: User management, configuration changes
ADMIN:      Full system access, security configurations
AUDITOR:    Read-only access to audit logs and security data
```

#### Session Management

- JWT tokens with short expiration (15 minutes)
- Secure refresh token rotation
- Session monitoring and anomaly detection
- Automatic logout on inactivity

### 5. Audit Logging

#### Required Log Events

- Authentication attempts (success/failure)
- Data access and modifications
- Administrative actions
- API calls with request/response metadata
- System configuration changes
- Security events and alerts

#### Log Security

- **Immutable Logs**: Write-only audit trail
- **Digital Signatures**: Log integrity verification
- **Centralized Logging**: Secure log aggregation
- **Retention**: 7-year retention for HIPAA compliance
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Automated threat detection

### 6. Network Security

#### API Security

- Rate limiting (100 requests/minute per user)
- IP allowlisting for administrative access
- CORS restrictions to specific domains
- Request size limits (10MB max)
- Input validation and sanitization

#### Infrastructure

- Network segmentation
- Firewall rules (default deny)
- VPN access for remote administration
- DDoS protection
- Intrusion detection and prevention

### 7. Data Privacy

#### PII Protection

- Automatic PII detection and classification
- Data masking in non-production environments
- Pseudonymization for analytics
- Right to erasure (GDPR Article 17)

#### Data Minimization

- Collect only necessary data
- Automatic data retention policies
- Secure data disposal procedures
- Regular data inventory audits

### 8. Vulnerability Management

#### Dependency Scanning

- Automated vulnerability scanning for Python packages
- Daily security updates for critical vulnerabilities
- Dependency pinning with security monitoring
- Software composition analysis (SCA)

#### Code Security

- Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
- Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
- Secure code review processes
- Penetration testing (quarterly)

### 9. Incident Response

#### Response Team

- Security incident response team (SIRT)
- 24/7 security operations center (SOC)
- Breach notification procedures (72 hours)
- Forensic investigation capabilities

#### Recovery Procedures

- Automated backup validation
- Disaster recovery testing (monthly)
- Business continuity planning
- Communication protocols

### 10. Security Monitoring

#### Continuous Monitoring

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
- User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA)
- File integrity monitoring
- Configuration drift detection

#### Alerting

- Real-time security alerts
- Automated threat response
- Security metrics and KPIs
- Executive reporting
